It's a full stack app with these features.
1.Users can sign up for an account and log in.
2) Each user can create multiple to-do lists, each with a name and a description.
3) Within each to-do list, users can create multiple to-do items, each with a name and a
checkbox indicating whether the item is complete.
4) Users can view their own to-do lists and items, as well as the to-do lists of other users
(but not the items in those lists).
5) The application should have a RESTful API that allows developers to create, read,
update, and delete to-do lists and items.
6) The application should be built using a modern web framework such as React, Angular,
or Vue.js for the front-end, and Node.js or Django for the back-end.
7) The application should use a database such as MySQL, MongoDB, or PostgreSQL to
store user information, to-do lists, and to-do items.
